Solar Access Recipe.

-

    Args:
        _sunVectors: A list of vectors that represents sun vectors. You can use
            Ladybug sunpath to generate the vectors for any time of the year. If
            you're generating the vectors in a different way make sure that the
            vectors are looking downwards from the sun (e.g. z = 0).
        _analysisGrids: List of honeybee analysis grids. Use Analysis grid component
            which you can find under 00 :: Create to create them.
        _timestep_: Timstep for sun vectors. Default is 1 which means each sun vector
            represents an hour of time.
        
    Returns:
        readMe!: Reports, errors, warnings, etc.
        analysisRecipe: Sunlight hours analysis recipe. Connect this recipe to
            Run Radiance Simulation to run a sunlight hours analysis.
