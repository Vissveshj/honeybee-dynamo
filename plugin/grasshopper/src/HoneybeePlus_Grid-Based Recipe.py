Grid-based Recipe.

-

    Args:
        _sky: A radiance sky. Find honeybee skies under 02::Daylight::Light Sources.
        _testPoints: A list or a datatree of points. Each branch of the datatree
            will be considered as a point group.
        ptsVectors_: A list or a datatree of vectors. Each vector represents the
            direction of the respective test point in testPoints. If only one
            value is provided it will be used for all the test points. If no value
            is provided (0, 0, 1) will be assigned for all the vectors.
        _analysisType_: Analysis type. [0] illuminance(lux), [1] radiation (kwh),
            [2] luminance (Candela).
        _radiancePar_: Radiance parameters for Grid-based analysis. Find Radiance
            parameters node under 03::Daylight::Recipes.
    Returns:
        readMe!: Reports, errors, warnings, etc.
        analysisRecipe: Grid-based analysis recipe. Connect this recipe to
            Run Radiance Analysis to run a grid-based analysis.
